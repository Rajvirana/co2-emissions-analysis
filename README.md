# CO₂ Emissions Analysis Project  

This mini-project analyzes global CO₂ emissions trends from 1990–2020 using Python, Google Colab, and real-world datasets.  

## Project Structure  
- `data/` → datasets (CSV/Excel)  
- `notebooks/` → Google Colab notebooks for analysis  
- `results/` → graphs, plots, and processed outputs  
- `references/` → research papers, citations (exported from Mendeley)  
- `report/` → final research report (Word/LaTeX)  

## Tools Used  
- **Google Colab** → data analysis & visualization  
- **GitHub** → version control & collaboration  
- **Mendeley** → reference management & citations  

## Next Steps  
1. Upload dataset into `data/`  
2. Write code in Colab and save in `notebooks/`  
3. Save graphs/outputs into `results/`  
4. Manage references in `references/`  
5. Write final report in `report/`
